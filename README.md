# Machine Learning Project

This repository contains machine learning experiments and case studies developed as part of the **project**. It explores both **classical ML approaches** and **modern deep learning techniques**, with a focus on reproducibility, evaluation, and comparison.

---

##  Key Highlights

* **Sentiment Analysis (IMDB dataset)**

  * Traditional ML baselines: Bag-of-Words + Logistic Regression, Random Forest
  * Transformer-based deep learning: DistilBERT
  * Performance benchmarking (Accuracy, F1-score, training efficiency)

* **Product Classification (FashionX dataset)**

  * End-to-end pipeline for image/text-based product categorization
  * Feature engineering and optimization
  * Model evaluation and improvement strategies

---

##  Goals

* Compare classical ML vs modern transformer models on real-world tasks
* Provide reproducible workflows in Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) format
* Serve as a reference for applying ML to NLP and classification problems

---

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

* Python 3.8+
* Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab
* Required libraries:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Running the Notebooks

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/machine-learning-sga-project.git
   cd machine-learning-sga-project
   ```
2. Open Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Navigate to the `.ipynb` files and run the cells step by step.

##  Results

* DistilBERT outperforms traditional ML models on sentiment analysis in terms of accuracy and generalization.
* Classical ML approaches still offer competitive results with lower computational cost.
* Product classification experiments demonstrate the trade-off between feature engineering and deep learning models.
